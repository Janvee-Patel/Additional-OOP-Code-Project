# Object Oriented Programming Project with m,n,k Tic Tac Toe Game

This is a project consisting of code to run a m,n,k Tic Tac Toe Game that has 2 players (the user and 1 of 3 computer players: AI0, AI1, AI2). AI0 randomly choose a position (Easy Mode). AI1 chooses a position if it can win, otherwise chooses randomly (Medium Mode). AI2 chooses a position if it can win or the user can win, otherwise chooses randomly (Hard Mode). The user sets the conditions for the tic-tac-toe board with m, n, k as number of rows, number of columns, and number of win marks respectively. 

The second aspect of the project was a statistical analysis of how the 3 computer players play against each other with varying board sizes. The probability of winning for the 3 competitions (AI0 vs AI1, AI0 vs AI2, AI1 vs AI2) were computed with repeated simulations.
